# Arctic_Circle_Or_Aztec_Diamond
Hello, This project attempts to create and display something called the Arctic Circle or Aztec Diamond.
The rules for the generation of this grid can be seen on the YouTube channel Mathologer. The video link are here:

to skip just to the rules start about here: https://youtu.be/Yy7Q8IWNfHM?t=1270

How to operate:
New updated Version 2
change the number in the window and press button to generate the graph.
Currntly I changed the code so that the first 2 are not generating due to an error in the colors turning black.
added a loading bar so that the user can see how long it takes to load, and that something is happening.


improvements:
Please let me know if there is something that can increase the speed of the code. I want to run large sizes greater than 10^3 x 10^3 like 10^100 x 10^100. This may crash Matlab at this time and exceed the memory of my computer. I also expect the it takes the code to run gets logorithmically longer.
